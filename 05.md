subtitle: Session to be taught by María Vargha [Tuesday	17.04.	15:15 - 16:45	Seminarraum Geschichte 1 Hauptgebäude, 1.Stock, Stiege 10]

# Goals:

Introduction to “geographical information systems” (GIS) and some of the basics techniques. The focus will be mainly on how one can digitize an image of a map—the process of georeferencing—and extract useful geographical information from it.


# Software:

* QGIS, a Free and Open Source Geographic Information System
(install it from <https://qgis.org/en/site/>) 


# Class:

* Basics of QGIS
* Basics of georeferencing

# Images of Maps

# Homework:

1. Georeference the map of the US during the Civil War;
2. Collect coordinates for place names from the map (into a CSV format: name, latitude, longitude).
3. Images of Maps are above
4. Codecademy’s *Learn Python*, Unit 3-4.
5. Github: publish the confirmation screenshot as a post on your new site.
